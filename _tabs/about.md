#### Hello, Ashu here.

I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineering student at NIT Patna, India, deeply passionate about systems programming and AI. I mostly build things in Rust and C, and use Python for AI work. I'm also comfortable with Java for data structures and algorithms. I’m always on the hunt for good low-level code to learn from—it fascinates me.

I can't really be specific about what exactly I like in systems programming since it involves a lot of things. I've worked on interpreters, operating systems, databases, and network protocols, and I seemed to like all of them. I've tried my hand at making them; they didn't turn out to be as great, but I did learn a lot in the process. Haven't really worked on security yet, but I do like the idea of it. Let's see.

I've played around with Deep Learning and Generative AI. I'm drawn to the idea of using AI as a daily assistant. I've just checked out things here and there, tried to build some agents, and read about some existing deep learning architectures and how they work.

We all love Jarvis, don't we? Someday, I want to make my own personal AI much like Tony Stark's Jarvis. I want to be able to talk to it and get things done.

I like to write about whatever I learn, so you can find some of my articles on Medium as of now. I'm a college student, so I don't get much time to write articles. I write whenever I can. I'll try to migrate the articles here as well.

You can poke around my projects on my Github. I keep them updated with whatever I'm working on.

If you got an idea or want to work with me on something, I would love to hear from you! You can find my info on the sidebar.
