Welcome to my website! I'm a college student interested in systems programming and AI. I love building things in Rust and C, and I dabble in Python for AI projects.

Feel free to explore my projects and blog posts. If you have any questions or just want to say hi, don't hesitate to reach out to me through discord or mail!
